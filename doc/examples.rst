Examples
========
If you downloaded a source archive or cloned pyQode from github, you will find a
series of examples in the ``examples`` directory, at the root of the archive.

All examples requires ``pyqode.qt``, ``pyqode.core`` and
``pyqode.json`` to be installed.

.. note:: All examples are bindings independent so that every user can run them
          without being required to install an unwanted qt binding.
